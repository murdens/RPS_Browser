<strong>Rock Paper Scissors - web browser</strong>

Brief: To give the game a simple UI to play.  Making use of the DOM.

Use of:-
- Query selectors
- Creating elements and append child node
- Event listeners
- Hoisting

I found the JS grew some legs as I added more functionality and with more knowledge can be refactored.  It was fun to make and was super excited when it actually worked !

Rock Paper Scissors - web browser, using the DOM.

Brief: To give the game a simple UI, so user can click buttons to play

Use of:-
- Query selectors
- Creating elements and append child node
- Event listeners

I think the project code be made much simpler and use more DOM methods than I have been able to at this stage.  Perhaps with more knowledge I can come back to this and refactor it.
